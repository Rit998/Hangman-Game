# Hangman-Game

This is a simple game that is constructed using basics of pygame, using knowledge of math and random modules.

What this does is that we give an input of random things or names to it in the code and as we have used random module it chooses any random word and we have to guess the word.

We have six tries to guess the word.

If we guess the right word it shows the output as "YOU WON"
But if we cannot guess the word then we display a stick figure of a person hanging which is why it is known as hangman game lol.

If we lose then the ouput shows us "YOU LOST"

Now you can input any words you like in this code but write them all in caps.
